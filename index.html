            Visiting the Village: After taking some rest and meeting with
            people, one of my cousins Bhuvan asked me to go out. I was agreed
            and few of us planned to take a little walk through the village. I
            wanted to see the entire village. We met lots of people on the road.
            I know some of them and donâ€™t know some. Itâ€™s a really great
            experience to see the village from so close. Lots of things have
            been changed but the beauty of an Indian village was still there.

            When she came here a few years ago she was a kid, she canâ€™t remember
            anything and thatâ€™s why she has to learn everything again. I find
            all of my cousins and went to our home with them. My cousins are
            really helpful. They love me a lot. Whenever I visit the village,
            they try to spend all of the time with me. They really care about
            me.

            She draws a landscape that was looking awesome. I loved that
            drawing. Nikhil was second and I was third. I wasnâ€™t worried about
            my ranking, because they both made an amazing drawing. And overall,
            it was a fun competition. Conclusion: I spend a really amazing time
            with my cousins. I wish I can spend all of my holidays with them.
